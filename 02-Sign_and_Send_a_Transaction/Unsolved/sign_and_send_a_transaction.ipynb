    "# Sign and Send a Transaction\n",
    "In this activity, you will create a new transaction object that will transfer some of your Ganache ether funds to another account. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the mnemonic seed phrase provided by Ganache, you will re-generate your HD wallet and your Ethereum public-private key pair and account address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have established the account and transaction information, you will send the signed transaction to the local Ganache blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete each of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the `Unsolved` folder, create a `.env` file that contains your mnemonic seed phrase (provided by Ganache). Import the `MNEMONIC` variable into the notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the variable associated with your mnemonic seed phrase, and the `Wallet` class from the bip44 package, to generate a wallet instance. Then, derive your private and public keys by calling the `.derive_account` method on the `wallet` object and passing it the string “eth”. Save the two returned values as variables named `private` and `public`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pass the private-key value to `Account.privateKeyToAccount`, and save the returned account object as a variable named `account`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Call `account.address`, and save it as a new variable named `account_address`. Then, print the `account_address` variable to get your public Ethereum address from your public key.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Define a new variable named `amount`, and set it to a float amount (in ether) that you would like to send&mdash;for example, 0.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Select any of your Ganache accounts other than the first one, index 0. Copy the account address, and store it in a new variable named `receiver`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Call the `w3.toWei` function, and convert your `amount` variable to the equivalent amount in ether. Save this value as a new variable named `value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Call `w3.eth.setGasPriceStrategy(medium_gas_price_strategy)` to configure the medium gas price strategy for your wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Call `w3.eth.estimateGas`, and pass it an object with the following values: { \"to\": receiver, \"from\": account_address, \"value\": value}. Save it as a variable named `gasEstimate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Construct a transaction object named `raw_tx`. It should contain the attributes `to`, `from`, `value`, `gas`, `gasPrice`, and `nonce`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set `to` to the value of the variable `receiver`.\n",
    "* Set `from` to the value of the variable `account_address`.\n",
    "* Set `value` to the value of the variable `value`.\n",
    "* Set `gas` to the value of the variable `gasEstimate`.\n",
    "* Set `gasPrice` to 0.\n",
    "* Set `nonce` to the value of the function `w3.eth.getTransactionCount(account_address)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Call `account.signTransaction`, and pass it the `raw_tx` object to sign the transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Call `w3.eth.sendRawTransaction`, and pass it `signed_tx.rawTransaction` to execute the transaction on the Ganache blockchain. View the HexBytes transaction code that is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Navigate to the Ganache Transaction tab, and view the transaction.\n",
